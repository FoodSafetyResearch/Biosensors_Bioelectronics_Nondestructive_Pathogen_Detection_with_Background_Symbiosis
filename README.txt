'DFFNN_Codes' is the NN algorithm.
'DFFNN-LSL2SC_Codes' is the advanced NN algorithm with learn schedule, L2 regularization, and shortcuts. 
'4C_Dataset' is the sample databset of the digitized Delta R/G/B data. column A is the sample code; column B-BX are the digitized Delta R/G/B data. 
'Sample_output' fold includes sample training results over 8,000 iterations using both DFFNN and DFFNN-LSL2SC algorithms.
